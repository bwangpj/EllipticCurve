Like `rw`, and unlike `nth_rewrite`, it will try to close the goal by trying `rfl`\nafterwards. `nth_rw n₁ ... nₖ [eq₁, eq₂,..., eqₘ]` will rewrite the `n₁, ..., nₖ`ᵗʰ _occurrence_ of\neach of the `m` equalities `eqᵢ`in that order. Occurrences are counted beginning with `1` in\norder of precedence. For example,\n```lean\nexample (h : a = 1) : a + a + a + a + a = 5 := by\n  nth_rw 2 3 [h]\n/-\na: ℕ\nh: a = 1\n⊢ a + 1 + 1 + a + a = 5\n-/\n```\nNotice that the second and third occurrences of `a` from the left have been rewritten by\n`nth_rw`.\n\nTo understand the importance of order of precedence, consider the example below\n```lean\nexample (a b c : Nat) : (a + b) + c = (b + a) + c := by\n  nth_rewrite 2 [Nat.add_comm] -- ⊢ (b + a) + c = (b + a) + c\n```\nHere, although the occurrence parameter is `2`, `(a + b)` is rewritten to `(b + a)`.
